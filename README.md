## Features

Some fun features the website has includes:

  - To login, the user will type in <code>customer</code> with any number from 1-50. Each number represents a specific user with their own specific details.
  - User can filter by several different preferences: date, room type, if it has a bidet, bed size and number of beds.
  - If there are no available rooms to book or the user doesn't have any past, present or future rooms coming up a message will be displayed to book a room. 
  - The amount the user spends on the top right corner updates as they book rooms. This is so that the user can keep track of how much they have spent in bookings.
